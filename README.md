# Content Based Image Retrieval Analysis (a.k.a. COBRA)

A python library that illustrates how to do "Content Based image Retrieval Analysis", a technique for prompting vision-enabled LLMs to extract details from video and image content.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your device.
Navigate to the repository directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd /path/to/local/repo/cobrapy
 pip install -e . #"." means install at the current location
```

2. Follow the official instructions to download and install FFmpeg:
[https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

3. Copy `sample.env` to `.env` at the repository root and populate it with your service credentials. The backend and UI components both consume environment variables from this shared file. Run `python scripts/apply_database_url.py` to materialize the local `DATABASE_URL` entry using the shared values in `config/database_urls.json`; the same configuration file provides the cloud connection string used by the container setup and deployment scripts.

4. Start the FastAPI backend on port 8000:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn cobrapy.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

5. In a separate terminal, install the UI dependencies and start the Next.js frontend on port 3000:

```bash
cd src/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI automatically proxies requests to `http://localhost:8000`, so no additional environment variables are required to wire the services together.

## Deploy to Azure with Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The fastest way to deploy VIPER to Azure is using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) (`azd`).

### Prerequisites

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- An Azure subscription

### Quick Start

1. Copy `sample.env` to `.env` and populate it with your Azure service credentials:

   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   # Edit .env with your Azure OpenAI, Speech, Storage, and Search credentials
   ```

2. Initialize the azd environment (first time only):

   ```bash
   azd init
   ```

3. Provision infrastructure and deploy:

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   This command will:
   - Create or update Azure resources (Container Registry, Container Apps, Storage, Search, Cosmos DB)
   - Build and push Docker images for the backend and frontend
   - Deploy the containers with environment variables from your `.env` file

### Environment Variables

The deployment inherits configuration from your `.env` file. Key variables include:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_VISION_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint for vision analysis |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_VISION_API_KEY` | API key for Azure OpenAI |
| `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` | Azure Speech Services region |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL` | Blob storage URL for videos |
| `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` | Azure AI Search endpoint |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |

See `sample.env` for the complete list of configuration options.

### Manual Deployment

For more control over the deployment process, use the PowerShell script:

```powershell
./scripts/Deploy-ViperToAzure.ps1 \
    -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" \
    -ResourceGroupName "viper-prod" \
    -Location "eastus"
```

See `azure/README.md` for detailed deployment options.
